# **Project 3: Designing Information Hierarchy for Decision-Making**  

**Due Date:** March 9, 2025, 11:59 PM  
**Total Marks:** 100  

---

## **Objective**  

In this project, you will **collaboratively design an information hierarchy** for an application that allows users to:  

- **Identify and document issues within SIAT.**  
- **Propose actions to resolve those issues.**  
- **Evaluate the effectiveness of those actions.**  

The final deliverable will be an **interactive Figma prototype** showcasing your group's **information architecture and user flow**. Treat this as a **proposal** for how the application for **issue and action tracking** should be designed.  

The project is structured over **two weeks**:  
1. **Week 1: Workshop, Initial Prototyping & Feedback**  
2. **Week 2: Refinement & Interactive Prototyping**

## **Project Timeline & Instructions**  

### **Week 1: Workshop & Initial Prototyping**  

#### **In-Class Workshop (February 25, 2025)**  

**Goal:** Define key features and structure the **information hierarchy** of the app.  

1. **Brainstorming Issues (10 minutes)**  
   - In your groups, list **issues** you see in **SIAT at SFU** (e.g., course availability, student resources, communication gaps).  

2. **Propose Actions (10 minutes)**  
   - For each issue, propose **possible actions** to address it.  

3. **Evaluate & Debate Actions (20 minutes)**  
   - Discuss what makes an action **effective, feasible, or challenging**.  
   - Identify **key factors** that influence decision-making.  

4. **Define a Preliminary Information Hierarchy (30 minutes, Group Activity)**  
   - Based on your discussion, outline **what types of information** the app should collect.  
   - Consider structuring it around:  
     - **Issues submitted by users.**  
     - **Actions suggested** to resolve those issues.  
     - **Potential outcomes** of those actions.  
     - **Evaluation methods** (e.g., user votes, expert feedback, impact assessment).  
   - These are **suggestions**—your group should define what makes the most sense for your app.  

5. **Diagram the User Story & Information Flow**  
   - Sketch a **user journey**: How a user interacts with the app from **issue creation to evaluation**.  
   - Visualize an **information flow**: How data is structured and connected.  

---

### **Week 1 Lab: Preliminary Prototyping**  

- Work in **groups** to create **low-fidelity wireframes** for your app in **Figma** or on **paper**.  
- Focus on:  
  - **Clarity of information hierarchy.**  
  - **Layout structure** for presenting issues, actions, and outcomes.  
  - **Logical user flow** through the app.  
- Submit your **wireframes/sketches** to the **Project 3 Lab Submission** on Canvas.  

---

### **Leading to Week 2: Refining Information Structure**  

1. **Revise & Update Based on Workshop Insights**  
   - Work with your group to refine your app’s information structure.  
   - Create a **user story diagram** based on [Nielsen Norman Group’s guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-story-mapping/).  
   - Ensure the **information hierarchy** is clear and follows best practices.  

2. **Finalize Wireframes**  
   - Iterate based on feedback.  
   - Ensure the **structure supports logical navigation and decision-making**.  

---

### **Week 2: Refinement & Interactive Prototyping**  

#### **Lab: Get Feedback on Wireframes & Start High-Fidelity Prototypes**  

1. **Peer Review & Refinement**  
   - Exchange **wireframes** with **one other group** for feedback.  
   - Focus on improving:  
     - **Visual clarity**  
     - **User interactions and flows**  
     - **Ease of navigation**  

2. **Convert Wireframes to a High-Fidelity Interactive Prototype**  
   - Refine your **Figma designs** to create a **polished, interactive prototype**.  
   - Add **interactivity** to allow users to navigate through:  
     - **Issue submission**  
     - **Action selection**  
     - **Outcome evaluation**  
   - Ensure the **visual hierarchy** effectively guides users.  

3. **Write a One-Page Proposal Summary**  
   - Summarize the rationale behind your app’s **design and hierarchy**.  
   - Explain:  
     - **How you structured the information.**  
     - **What challenges you encountered.**  
     - **How user feedback influenced your final design.**  

---

## **Submission Requirements**  

1. **Group Submission on Canvas**  
   - **Figma link** to your **interactive prototype**.  
   - **Final reflection (200 words):**  
     - How your team structured the information hierarchy.  
     - What challenges you encountered.  
     - How user feedback influenced your design.  

2. **Lab Submissions**  
   - **Week 1:** Low-fidelity wireframes.  
   - **Week 2:** Final interactive prototype.
