# **Project 3: Designing Information Hierarchy for Decision-Making (Two Weeks)**  

**Due Date:** March 9, 2025, 11:59 PM 
**Total Marks:** 100

---

## **Objective**  

In this project, you will **collaboratively design an information hierarchy** for an application that allows users to:  

- **Identify and document issues.**  
- **Propose actions to resolve those issues.**  
- **Evaluate the effectiveness of those actions.**   

This project will help you understand **how information is structured and presented** to users for **effective decision-making**. The final deliverable will be an **interactive Figma prototype** showcasing your group's information architecture and user flow.  

The project is structured over **two weeks**:  
1. **Week 1: Workshop, Initial Prototyping & Feedback**  
2. **Week 2: Refinement & Interactive Prototyping**

## **Project Timeline & Instructions**  

### **Week 1: Workshop & Initial Prototyping**  

#### **Lecture (Workshop - In-Class Activity, February 25, 2025)**  

**Goal:** Identify key features and structure the information hierarchy of the app.  

1. **Brainstorming Issues (10 minutes)**  
   - In your groups, list issues you see in **SIAT at SFU** (e.g., course availability, student resources, communication gaps).  

2. **Propose Actions (10 minutes)**  
   - For each issue, propose **possible actions** to address it.  

3. **Evaluate & Debate Actions (20 minutes)**  
   - Discuss what makes an action effective, feasible, or challenging.  
   - Identify **key factors** that influence decision-making.  

4. **Define a Preliminary Information Hierarchy (30 minutes, Group Activity)**  
   - Based on your discussion, outline what **types of information** the app should collect.  
   - Consider structuring it around:  
     - Issues users submit.  
     - Actions suggested to resolve those issues.  
     - Possible outcomes of those actions.  
     - Ways to evaluate actions (e.g., user votes, expert feedback, impact assessment).  
   - These are **suggestions**â€”your group should define what makes the most sense for your app.  

5. **Diagram the User Story & Information Flow**  
   - Sketch a **user journey**: How a user interacts with the app from **issue creation to evaluation**.  
   - Visualize an **information flow**: How data is structured and connected.  

#### **Lab (February 27-28, 2025): Preliminary Prototyping**  

- Work in **groups** to create **low-fidelity wireframes** for your app in **Figma** or on **paper**.  
- Focus on:  
  - **Clarity of information hierarchy.**  
  - **Layout structure** for presenting issues, actions, and outcomes.  
  - **Logical user flow** through the app.  
- Submit your **wireframes/sketches** to the **Project 3 Lab Submission** on Canvas.

### **Week 2: Refinement & Interactive Prototyping**  

#### **Self-Directed Work: Update Low-Fidelity Prototypes (March 3-5, 2025)**  

1. **Refine Information Structure**  
   - Review feedback from Week 1.  
   - Adjust the **hierarchy and user flow** based on insights.
   - Ensure all key information is **clearly organized and accessible**.  
   - Update wireframes to better represent interactions.


2. **Create Digital Wireframes in Figma**  
   - Convert your **paper sketches** into **low-fidelity wireframes** in Figma.  
   - Ensure that:  
     - The **layout makes sense** for decision-making.  
     - The **user flow is intuitive and seamless**.  

3. **Gather Feedback on Digital Wireframes**  
   - Ask at least **one other group** for feedback.  
   - Make **necessary refinements** to improve clarity and usability.

#### **Lab (March 6-7, 2025): High-Fidelity & Interactive Prototyping**  

- **Refine your Figma designs** into a **high-fidelity interactive prototype**.  
- Add **interactivity**: Users should be able to **navigate through issue creation, action selection, and outcome evaluation**.  
- Ensure the **visual hierarchy** guides users **logically and effectively**.  
- Submit your **interactive prototype link** and **final reflection** on Canvas.

## **Submission Requirements**  

1. **Group Submission on Canvas**  
   - **Figma link** to your **interactive prototype**.  
   - **Final reflection (200 words):**  
     - How your team structured the information hierarchy.  
     - What challenges you encountered.  
     - How user feedback influenced your design.  

2. **Lab Submissions**  
   - **Week 1:** Low-fidelity wireframes.  
   - **Week 2:** Final interactive prototype.

## **Marking Rubric (100 Marks)**  

| **Criteria**                        | **0%** | **25%** | **50%** | **75%** | **100%** | **Marks** |
|-------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Information Hierarchy Clarity**   | No clear structure. | Some structure, lacks coherence. | Basic hierarchy present, but inconsistent. | Clear and logical hierarchy supporting decision-making. | Strong, intuitive hierarchy improving user experience. | 30 |
| **Wireframe & Prototype Quality**  | No wireframe or prototype. | Incomplete wireframe, lacks clarity. | Basic prototype with limited interactivity. | Functional prototype with clear user flow. | Polished, professional interactive prototype. | 30 |
| **Integration of Feedback & Refinement**         | No feedback considered. | Minimal feedback applied. | Some improvements based on feedback. | Meaningful revisions enhancing usability. | Excellent integration of feedback leading to a high-quality prototype. | 20 |
| **Team Collaboration & Reflection** | No collaboration evident. | Uneven contribution, minimal reflection. | Some collaboration, basic reflection. | Effective teamwork, insightful reflection. | Strong collaboration, deep reflection on challenges and learning. | 20 |
